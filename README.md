# Paris Olympics Data Engineering Project in Microsoft Azure 🏅
## Overview 📝
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL process for analyzing Olympics data using Microsoft Azure services: Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Storage, and Azure Synapse Analytics. The dataset includes four tables: Athletes, Coaches, Teams, and Medals.

## Components Used ⚙️
1. Azure Data Factory 🏭
Orchestrated the ETL pipeline by extracting data from Azure Storage, transforming it in Databricks, and loading it into Azure Synapse Analytics.

2. Azure Databricks 🔥
Handled data transformation and analysis using PySpark. The cleaned and processed data was prepared for deeper insights, such as athlete performance trends and medal distributions.

3. Azure Storage 📦
Stored the raw Olympics data (CSV files) as the source for the pipeline.

4. Azure Synapse Analytics 📊
Served as the data warehouse, allowing complex SQL queries for team performance and medal analysis.
